    "Most programming involves work that is very similar to work that has been done before.  Since writing code is time-consuming, it's good to rely on others' published code when you can.  Rather than copy-pasting, Python allows us to **import** other code, creating a **module** that contains all of the names created by that code. You can think of a **module** as a storage space for the pieces of code you might want to use; having it in your code ensures that Python has access to the code you want to use.\n",
